# FSPM workshop

CPlantBox is a model used to simulated the growth and development of complex plant. Here we will use it to simulate a root system architecture. 

## Play with the model and the parameters

For a first try, we will use a user-friendly web interface to get to know the different parameters of the model.

ShinyApp : https://plantmodelling.shinyapps.io/shinyRootBox/

## Python interface

To go further, we have developped a Python interface to interact with our C++ model
